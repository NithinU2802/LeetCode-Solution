Count the number of possible triangle....

You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. 
You are also given a 2D array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei] indicates 
that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi with a distance equal 
to distancei. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance 
of a road in this path.

Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n.

Note:

A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you
can visit cities 1 and n multiple times along the path.
The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between 1 and n.

Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]] m=4 // considering m as no of roads
Output: 5

Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]] m=3 // considering m as no of roads
Output: 2
